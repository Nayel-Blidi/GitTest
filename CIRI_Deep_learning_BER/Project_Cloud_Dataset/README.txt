Machine Learning project based on an introductive course to Machine Learning.

The objective of the project was to only use ML algorithm and techniques 
developed from scratch during the class.
The rough compilation of these functions can be found in the ML.py file. 
Be aware that all the fuctions are not perfeclty scalable, as some of them 
were developed for a precise example, and not updated since. 
On the other hand, all of the functions called in the project have been improved 
to fit a wider scale of data inputs, to be more adaptable, and to sometimes use 
some library packages, mainly for speed effectiveness purposes.

The report of the project can be found in the "Project_Cloud_Report" file.
Be aware that due to cloud limitations, the original datasets are not included,
an the same applies for the referenced figures, plots, and pictures outputs.
Those might be included in a later version.
